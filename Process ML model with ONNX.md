GENERAL

1. **Model Training**:
    - Train your machine learning model using your preferred framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).

2. **Convert to ONNX Format**:
    - Convert the trained model to the ONNX format. This standardizes the model representation for easier interoperability.
    - the pre-trained models are here: https://github.com/onnx/tutorials
    - here too: https://github.com/onnx/models
3. **Save the ONNX Model**:
    - Save the ONNX model file to your local storage or cloud storage (e.g., Amazon S3).

4. **Containerize the Model with Docker**:
    - Create a Dockerfile that specifies the environment and dependencies required for your model.
    - Build a Docker image containing the ONNX model and any necessary libraries.

5. **Push the Docker Image to a Repository**:
    - Use Docker commands to push the created image to a Docker image repository (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR). This stores the image as an artifact for versioning and future retrieval.

6. **Deploy the Model**:
    - Deploy the Docker image in a production environment. This could be on cloud services, local servers, or edge devices where inference will occur.

7. **Serve Predictions**:
    - Set up an inference service that listens for requests and uses the deployed ONNX model to generate predictions.

8. **Monitor and Maintain**:
    - Continuously monitor the modelâ€™s performance in production, and update the model or container image as needed.

9. **Manage Versioning**:
    - Keep track of different versions of the model and container images to ensure that you can roll back or reproduce earlier versions if required.
