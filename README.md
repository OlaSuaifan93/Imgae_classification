# Imgae_classification
Implemented and deployed an ONNX-based image recognition model (ResNet50) for image classification and similarity search in support of potential e-commerce application.


### 1. **Understanding the ONNX Model (ResNet50)**
- **What is it?** You’re working with an ONNX model, specifically ResNet50, which is a pre-trained deep learning model known for image classification.
- **Why use ResNet50?** ResNet50 is commonly used because it can classify images into categories, like identifying if an image contains a cat, a dog, a car, etc. It's great for handling image recognition tasks without needing to build a model from scratch.
- **Why ONNX format?** ONNX (Open Neural Network Exchange) is a model format that allows models to be run across different frameworks (like TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.). So, if someone trained a model in PyTorch, you can still use it in a different framework or system.

### 2. **The Code: Setting Up and Running Inference**
- **What does the code do?** The code you've been working with loads an image, preprocesses it (resize, normalize, etc.), runs the ONNX model (ResNet50) on that image, and outputs predictions (like what objects or categories the image contains).
- **Real-life application:** Imagine you want to create an app that detects objects in photos for sorting images automatically or identifying objects for search and categorization—this code is a simple version of that setup.

### 3. **Containerizing with Docker**
- **Why Docker?** Docker allows you to package the model and its environment (like Python, ONNX runtime, and any other dependencies) into a single, portable container. This makes sure that the model can run consistently on any system, avoiding issues like “it works on my computer but not on the server.”
- **Real-life scenario:** If you wanted to deploy this model in production (say, on a cloud server), using Docker means that anyone (or any machine) with Docker installed can run your model without needing to install libraries individually or configure an environment.

### 4. **Pushing the Image to a Repository**
- **What’s a Docker repository?** This is where you store Docker images (like Docker Hub or AWS ECR). Think of it as cloud storage for your Docker images.
- **Why push to a repository?** In real-life situations, teams or systems can pull the image from the repository and run the model on other machines, in the cloud, or even on other developers' laptops.

### 5. **Deploying the Model in Production**
- **Why deploy?** Deployment means you’re making the model accessible so that others (or other systems) can use it in real-time. For example, if your app users want to upload an image and get a classification in response, they need a deployed model running in the background to process these requests.
- **How?** By running the Docker container on a cloud server, local server, or even an edge device (like IoT hardware), the model can serve predictions to users or other systems.

### 6. **Serving Predictions and Monitoring**
- **How are predictions served?** Usually, an API (like a REST API) is set up to take input images, run the model, and return predictions. Users or other services can then call this API whenever they need an inference.
- **Why monitor?** In production, you want to make sure the model performs well over time. If accuracy drops or if the model slows down, you’ll want to update it or investigate any issues.

### Real-Life Scenario Summarized:
Let’s say you’re building an image-based app. In the early stages, you can use code similar to yours to verify that ResNet50 works well on your images. Once you’re ready to deploy for real users, containerizing with Docker, pushing to a repository, and deploying on a server will let users start making requests, and the app can respond with accurate predictions in real-time.

This setup is used in many fields, such as:
- **E-commerce:** Classifying images for product categorization or visual search.
- **Healthcare:** Recognizing objects in medical images.
- **Agriculture:** Detecting diseases or counting animals in images.
